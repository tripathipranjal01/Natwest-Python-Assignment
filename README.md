# Report Generator Microservice

This is a backend microservice developed using **FastAPI** to fulfill the NatWest Markets Backend Developer Assessment. It allows users to upload structured CSV files and transformation rules in YAML format to generate a final report in CSV, Excel, and JSON formats.

---

## Features

- Upload `input.csv` and `reference.csv`
- Upload transformation logic via `rules.yaml`
- Merge and process data based on rules
- Output report in CSV, XLSX, and JSON formats
- Input validation and structured logging
- Docker support for easy deployment
- Swagger UI for API interaction
- Unit test for core functionality

## Validations

- Ensures required columns are present in uploaded CSVs
- YAML file is parsed and validated for necessary keys (`outfield`, `operation`, `fields`)
- Supports UTF-8, UTF-8 BOM, ISO encodings
- Logs every transformation step
